# tech-hackathon

## 1. Run the project
```
cd backend/jerry-service
npm run start:dev
```

## 2. Send an email to
`hackathon@config.one`

### Example:
```
This is my github: 
https://github.com/jakobklippel/tech-hackathon

And this is my loom video:
https://www.loom.com/share/473fad25ebd24b5ea8091503253dfecf
```

### Expected Result (console output)
```
## Does it use OpenAI?
Yes

## Video summary
In the loom video, Sam from the Loom team demonstrates an improved product feature using async video. Sam narrates a walkthrough where a user previously faced a dead-end scenario when trying to accept a workspace invite from a wrong email, which was frustrating. A design update now guides the user to correct the email situation without hitting a dead-end, reducing user friction and improving the experience when joining workspaces.

## Closing Remarks
The project seems to involve OpenAI as per the `package.json` file, indicating potential AI functionalities being integrated. The improved workflow showcased in the video reflects a user-centric approach to addressing usability challenges.
